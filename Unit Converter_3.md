## Version 3

Add support for yards, and inches.

```
1 yard is 0.9144 m
1 inch is 0.0254 m
```

Below is an example of how you should structure your function: 

```python
def unit_converter():
    - input: "what is the distance?" 100
    - input: "what are the units?" mi
    - return : "<initial value> <units> is <converted amount> <units>"

```

Check the test case to see the expected result.
